                        Counselling sessions last between 50 minutes and 1 hour, but sometimes shorter or longer sessions can be <br />
                        arranged. If you arrive late for your session, please be aware that you will receive less time. If you know you are <br /> 
                        going to be late it is advised to contact your counsellor to inform them or re-schedule for another new appointment.

                        <h3>​​Does my concern have to be a serious one to see a counsellor?</h3>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                        No, many personal concerns, difficulties in relationships or academic-related problems etc can be helped through <br />
                        talking. Seeing a counsellor and talking about your worries can help.

                        <br />
                        <p>
                        What is disclosed and discussed in the session is private and confidential. However your problems maybe such <br />
                        that it may be in your best interest to involve (with your consent) others ie, Programme Director, lecturer etc. <br />
                        Confidentiality is breached when there are legal or statutory obligations to disclose, or if there is a risk of serious <br />
                        harm to the client or to others. This is in line with our Centre for Counselling Services (CCS) policy and procedures.

                        <p>
                        Yes. It is in line with our policy and professional practice that the Centre for Counselling Services (CCS) keeps <br />
                        statistical information on clients. Counsellors will document notes about what happens during sessions. All <br />
                        documentation is strictly confidential and does not go outside the centre.
