                        Counselling sessions last between 50 minutes and 1 hour, but sometimes shorter or longer <br />
                        sessions can be arranged. If you arrive late for your session, please be aware that you will <br />
                        receive less time. If you know you are going to be late it is advised to contact your counsellor to <br />
                        inform them or re-schedule for another new appointment.

                        <p>
                        Once a student made an appointment, we will schedule him/her within 1-working day subject to <br />
                        the availability of the counsellor.

                        We will always try our best to accommodate you and would want to see you, as soon as <br />
                        possible. However due to the demands of our services this may not always be possible. Please <br />
                        note we are open from Monday to Friday 8am-6pm and are not open at weekends and Public <br />
                        Holidays.

                        What is disclosed and discussed in the session is private and confidential. However your <br />
                        problems maybe such that it may be in your best interest to involve (with your consent) others <br />
                        ie, Programme Director, lecturer etc. Confidentiality is breached when there are legal or statutory <br />
                        obligations to disclose, or if there is a risk of serious harm to the client or to others. This is in line <br />
                        with our Centre for Counselling Services (CCS) policy and procedures.

                        <p>
                        Yes. It is in line with our policy and professional practice that the Centre for Counselling <br />
                        Services (CCS) keeps statistical information on clients. Counsellors will document notes about <br />
                        what happens during sessions. All documentation is strictly confidential and does not go <br />
                        outside the centre.
